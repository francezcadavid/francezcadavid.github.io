            20.05|23.30|I spent the summer on your couch
            23.30|26.55|You fell in love with someone else
            26.55|32.06|You came to me the times that it went bad
            32.06|35.05|I'm somethin' so familiar

            58.80|62.30|I'll sell my soul, sell my guitar
            62.30|65.54|Sleep in the back of a beat-up car
